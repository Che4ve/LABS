//TASK: Multiply two numbers
//EXAMPLES: |||#|| --> |||||| //(3*2 = 6)

//Alphabet
T = {|, #, B, @, *, S,E, Q}
//Input alphabet
I = {|, #}

//Move * to the end of the line
*| -> |*
*# -> @* //Replace # with @
* -> E //When * arrived replace it with E

SQ -> |S

//Move B to the left and create copies of the | marked as Q

//If Q arrived to the left wright | to result
|B -> BQ|
//Move Q to the left
|Q -> Q|

//Replace one | at right to @ in left
@| -> B@

//If there are no more multiplication the clean buffer
|E -> E
@E -> E

//When buffer is clear terminate
